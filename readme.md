# Instructions for Project 2

## Ian Zhang

1. Put `project2.py` and the zip file `project2_data.zip` in the same folder. Make sure the name of the zip file is exactly **`project2_data.zip`**. You don't need to unzip the zip file. The data will be read without unzipping the zip file.

2. Please make sure the following libraries are installed before you run the program. Run the command below to install the required packages.

```
pip install -U numpy pandas openpyxl scikit-learn
```

3. Run the command below:

```
python3 project2.py
```

4. The whole project takes about 40min to complete on the server. There will be five `.xlsx` files generated by the program: `results_D.xlsx`, `results_BG.xlsx`, `results_RF.xlsx`, `results_GB.xlsx` and `MNIST.xlsx`. The results are included in these files. I hope you enjoy this one. Thanks!
